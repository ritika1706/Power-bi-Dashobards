About project:
I’m excited to share a project I worked on during my internship at NullClass – a Twitter Analytics Dashboard in Power BI.
The goal of this dashboard was to help a marketing team monitor and analyze Twitter campaign performance.
✨ Key Features I implemented:
✅ Dynamic time-window visuals → visuals appear only within defined hours (e.g., 3–5 PM campaign monitoring).
✅ Best time to tweet analysis → heatmap to identify the most engaging time slots.
✅ Drill-down & Drill-through → move from high-level KPIs to tweet-level engagement details.
✅ Advanced DAX → used functions like RANKX, CALCULATE, FILTER, SWITCH, and time-based logic for conditional visuals.
